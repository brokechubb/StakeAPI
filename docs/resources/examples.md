## Basic: Check Your Balance

The simplest possible StakeAPI script:

```python
import asyncio
from stakeapi import StakeAPI

async def main():
    async with StakeAPI(access_token="your_token") as client:
        balance = await client.get_user_balance()
        
        print("Available:")
        for currency, amount in balance["available"].items():
            if amount > 0:
                print(f"  {currency.upper()}: {amount}")

asyncio.run(main())
```

## Basic: Get User Profile

```python
import asyncio
from stakeapi import StakeAPI

async def main():
    async with StakeAPI(access_token="your_token") as client:
        user = await client.get_user_profile()
        print(f"Username: {user.username}")
        print(f"Verified: {user.verified}")
        print(f"Currency: {user.currency}")
        print(f"Member since: {user.created_at}")

asyncio.run(main())
```

```python
import asyncio
from stakeapi import StakeAPI

async def main():
    async with StakeAPI(access_token="your_token") as client:
        # Get slot games
        slots = await client.get_casino_games(category="slots")
        print(f"Found {len(slots)} slot games\n")
        
        for game in slots[:10]:
            rtp_str = f"RTP: {game.rtp}%" if game.rtp else "RTP: N/A"
            print(f"  {game.name} ({game.provider}) — {rtp_str}")

asyncio.run(main())
```

        for event in events[:10]:
            status = "🔴 LIVE" if event.live else "⏳ Upcoming"
            print(f"  {event.home_team} vs {event.away_team} [{status}]")
            print(f"    League: {event.league}")
            if event.odds:
                for market, odds in event.odds.items():
                    print(f"    {market}: {odds}")
            print()

asyncio.run(main())
```

```python
from stakeapi.auth import AuthManager

curl_command = '''
curl "https://stake.com/_api/graphql" \
  -H "x-access-token: your_token_here" \
  -b "session=your_session_here"
'''

token = AuthManager.extract_access_token_from_curl(curl_command)
session = AuthManager.extract_session_from_curl(curl_command)

print(f"Token: {token}")
print(f"Session: {session}")
```

```python
import asyncio
from stakeapi import StakeAPI

async def main():
    async with StakeAPI(access_token="your_token") as client:

        if not bets:
            print("No bets found")
            return
        
        won = [b for b in bets if b.status == "won"]
        lost = [b for b in bets if b.status == "lost"]
        
        total_wagered = sum(float(b.amount) for b in bets)

                prev = {k: v for k, v in balance["available"].items() if v > 0}
        except Exception as e:

        with open("bets.csv", "w", newline="") as f:
            w = csv.writer(f)
            w.writerow(["ID", "Type", "Amount", "Payout", "Status", "Date"])
            
            for b in bets:
                w.writerow([
                    b.id, b.bet_type, float(b.amount),
                    float(b.potential_payout), b.status,
                    b.placed_at.isoformat()
                ])

asyncio.run(export_bets())
```

## Advanced: Custom GraphQL Query

```python
